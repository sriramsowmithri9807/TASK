# TASK
# Stock Movement Prediction using Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts stock movements based on sentiment analysis of user-generated content from social media platforms. The model will leverage data scraped from Twitter, focusing on stock discussions and predictions to forecast stock price trends.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt`.

## Data Scraping

This project uses **Tweepy** to scrape tweets related to stock discussions. Users need to create a Twitter Developer account and obtain API keys for authentication.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

After scraping, clean the data to remove noise and prepare it for analysis. This includes removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and handling missing data.

## Sentiment Analysis

Utilize **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze tweet sentiments. Libraries such as **NLTK** can be used for sentiment scoring.

## Model Development

Build a machine learning model using libraries like **scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** to predict stock movements based on the processed data. Prepare the data for training, split it into training and testing sets, and train the model.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Detailed evaluation will provide insights into the model's effectiveness.

## Demo Video

An optional demo video demonstrating the scraping process, model training, and results is available. Upload the video to a platform like YouTube and include the link in your submission.
